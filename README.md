# **Security Techniques**

This repository contains implementations of various security techniques in Python, created as part of my Security Techniques course.

## **Techniques Implemented**

1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**  
   - A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission.
   - Implements encryption and decryption of plaintext using a shared key.

2. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**  
   - A public-key encryption algorithm for secure data exchange.
   - Demonstrates key generation, encryption, and decryption.

3. **Hill Cipher**  
   - A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
   - Encrypts plaintext using matrix multiplication.

4. **Vernam Cipher**  
   - A symmetric key stream cipher, also known as a one-time pad.
   - Ensures secure encryption when the key is as long as the plaintext.

5. **Vigenere Cipher**  
   - A method of encrypting alphabetic text using a series of Caesar ciphers.
   - Demonstrates encryption and decryption using a repeating key.

6. **Digital Signature**  
   - Ensures the authenticity and integrity of a message.
   - Uses cryptographic hashing and signing techniques.

7. **Custom Security Technique**  
   - A unique encryption method developed as part of the course project.
   - Combines elements of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
